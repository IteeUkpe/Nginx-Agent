Role Name
=========

This ansible role helps in installing Nginx Agent on NGINX Instance Manager.
NGINX Agent is a companion daemon for your NGINX Open Source or NGINX Plus instance. It enables:

- Remote management of NGINX configurations
- Collection and reporting of real-time NGINX performance and operating system metrics
- Notifications of NGINX events

Requirements
------------
On Data Plane:

1. NGINX OSS or NGINX Plus
2. A supported operating system and architecture
3. root privilege


NGINX Certificate Files
------------
Installing NGINX Agent requires the NGINX certificate files to access the repository. Log in to MyF5 or follow the link in the trial activation email to download the repo .crt and .key files:

- nginx-mgmt-suite-trial.key
- nginx-mgmt-suite-trial.crt

- NOTE: Be sure to rename these files to nginx-repo.key and nginx-repo.crt, respectively.

NGINX Instance
--------------
Data plane instances require NGINX - either NGINX OSS or NGINX Plus as a frontend only.

Main difference between using NGINX OSS or NGINX Plus depends on which Authentication Option you plan to use.
